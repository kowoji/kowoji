# Hey, I'm koji ðŸ‘‹ 

15 y/o software engineer pursuing full-stack development. 

# What I'm Working on

In August 2022, I co-founded [Worry](https://github.com/worryinc) with two of my friends. A development team focussing on real-time services. Our goal is to create scalable applications for daily use. Currently, we are focusing on a website called [Profiles](https://profiles.lol) which will bring customizable user profiles to the world! - You can easily connect domains to your custom profile, with the service being free! 

# Programs / Softwares I use

My goal is to become a full-stack developer. However, I'd say I still have a way to go before I get to that point. Currently, I focus more on the design and appeal of web development and some networking! Just below is a short list of software/programs I am proficient in!
